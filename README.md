# Shem

Shem is a new compiled-to-JS, statically typed, pure-by-default functional programming language. The semantics are based on [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) but the language evaluates strictly in a similar way to [PureScript](http://purescript.org/). The syntax is S-expressions-based, allowing for a full-blown LISP-like macro system. Shem's prelude includes a full-featured, highly-polymorphic collections library backed by [ImmutableJS](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js).

The language has been designed for the use within its custom built IDE, [Golem](https://github.com/xixixao/Golem) available at [http://shem.io/](http://shem.io/), inspired by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/).
